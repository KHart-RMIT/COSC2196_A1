Welcome to my Personal Profile for Assessment 1!

My name is Krystien. I'm 26 and have been working in customer service and IT support for 5 years. Currently I am working as a Desktop Support Officer for a hospital. I am an avid video- and board-gamer, especially strategy and survival games, and play softball for fun.

## Interest in IT
 
Computers have always been a constant companion in my life. For gaming, schoolwork, research, etc; IT has always been a useful tool and a way for me to create and interact with the wider world. Through my jobs I have gained experience in the administration and troubleshooting of many different aspects of IT, including: 
 - Microsoft Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10)
 - Microsoft Office Applications
 - MS Admin Tools (Active Directory)
 - Ticketing Systems
 - Basic IP networking
 - Basic Network Admin
 - Mobile Networking and applications
 - Printer Networking
 
 I chose to come to RMIT from the options provided through Online University. After some research I found that RMIT presented me with the strongest course that was most closely aligned with what I wanted to learn, and provided strong online support to help me succeed. I look forward to completing this course, and eventual degree, with them. 

During my strudies in this course I hope to learn the more advanced techniques that aren't normally available to be trained in the workplace. Network and computer management, hardware analysis and troubleshooting, server management (eg. Azure, Amazon Web) and powershell scripting are some of the main examples of what I look forward to learning. I also hope to undertake the IT Security elective to help develop my knowledge in anticipation of looking for work specifically in that sector. 

## Ideal Job
### [Security Analyst](https://www.seek.com.au/job/39805089)

The position of a Security Analyst calls for a couple of major roles. Not only do they continuously monitor systems for security alerts that they analyse and action; but also provide and create policies and user documentation, helpting to manage user behaviour and lead  to a more secure system and network. They also engage with major stakeholders (affected people) to keep them updated on any major alerts as they combat whatever attempted breaches occur. 

This advertised position requires advanced knowledge including: 
 - IT Threat assessment
 - Network and Cloud security management
 - Experience in documentation and policy writing
 - Experience in stakeholder engagment via written and oral means
 
 My own experience has granted me skills in:
 - Stakeholder engagement
 - User documentation writing
 - Basic software and hardware support
 - Basic user network administration. 

To obtain the remaining required skills neccessary, I will need to complete this degree along with the IT Security elective. I am also looking at attaining the COMPTIA A+ Security Certification for added qualification. By the time these courses are complete I will have completed 10 years in the IT industry, and should therefore be in a position to begin an entry-level IT Security role. 

## Personal Profile

### Myers-Briggs / 16 Personalities
#### INFP - "The Mediator" / "The Creative Seeker"
![Mediator Splash](https://storage.googleapis.com/neris/public/images/types/scenes/diplomats_Mediator_INFP_introduction.svg) 

>Mediator personalities are true idealists, always looking for the hint of good in even the worst of people and events, searching for ways to make things better. While they may be perceived as calm, reserved, or even shy, Mediators have an inner flame and passion that can truly shine. Comprising just 4% of the population, the risk of feeling misunderstood is unfortunately high for the Mediator personality type – but when they find like-minded people to spend their time with, the harmony they feel will be a fountain of joy and inspiration.
>
> In the workplace, Mediators face the challenge of taking their work and their profession personally. To Mediators, if it isn’t worth doing, it isn’t really worth doing, and this sense of moral purpose in their work colors everything from how they respond to authority to how they express it. Though the way the Mediator personality type shows through depends on the position, there are a few basic truths about what Mediators seek in the workplace: they value harmony, need an emotional and moral connection to their work, and loathe bureaucratic tedium.

### Reflection

I find the above reults to be a rather accurate summary of my personality and work management preferences. I find it affirming to have confirmation about certain areas of myself ive been guessing at and it provides a solid foundation for which i can improve my skills and balance my shortcomings. I feel this insight in to myself will be very beneficial in working with my gorup moving forward.

Now armed with this knowledge, I will be able to more confidently participate in group work. Understanding that how I act is perfectly natural, and that there are ways to help manage and work with my faults will allow me to better control how I act in group settings for the benefit of the team. As per the information in the 16 Personalities results; I will endeavour to keep my ideas confined to the possible and realistic to prevent uneccessary time spent on work that will not succeed. 

When forming a team, it would be more desirous to find people who are of similar learning types. This allows for whole team to "speak the same language" as it were and communicate most effectively. While attempting to maintain this it is also important to try and have a variety of personality and working types as there is always many different facets to a projects that all require attention. Knowing what the project was going to be before the team is formed would allow for more specific choices in people; eg through knowing what kind of skills and aspects the project was going to encompass. 

## Project Idea
### No Man's Sky  - Material Ratio Calculator / Recipe Book
![NMS Banner](https://www.nomanssky.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/logo.png)

#### Overview
At the base level, the app would be a database of all refinable and craft-able items in the game and their ingredients, and how to source the ingredients. The materials would also have a list of all recipes they are a part of and the amount needed. After that the recipes themselves would provide a ratio calculator for the user to determine their needs. 

#### Motivation
With the recent update release for No Man's Sky, the refining ratios and recipes available in the game have changed somewhat. This phone app would be run as a companion to the game played on console or PC to make the information easily accessible for gamers so they don’t have to search it via the wiki or for those who have trouble calculating ratios. 

#### Description
The app is designed to be a comprehensive database for all refinable and craft-able items in the game. As such it would contain a search engine so that not only does the required item come up in a search, but all items that are crafted / refined from that item. The information on the base materials would provide information on how to attain the item, and a list of all recipes it is a part of. The recipes would contain a ratio calculator to help determine required input or expected output and amount of time the refining would require. This becomes more advanced as high-teir items require crafted items. This would mean that the calculator would not only be presenting the required components of the requested item, but also the base materials of the components. A possible feature could also be a "shopping list" created from the ratio calculator to allow players to tick off items when they collected the required amounts of materials. 

#### Technologies
The main software required would be MIT App Inventor for the creation of the app. Support applications could include MS Excel or Google Sheets for key ratio formatting and formulas, and MS Access for database management. An Android phone would be required for testing and a computer for running the requisite software.

#### Skills Required
 - Experience with MIT App Inventor
 - Knowledge of the game's crafting trees

While the the successful networking of the informational tags and database will be difficult, the informational content will be realtively easy to obtain. The core obstacle will be my lack of knowldge and experience with MIT App Inventor, so it would take time to attain those skills. 

#### Outcome
The creation of this companion app would allow for a less stressful play through of the game for players who have difficulty calculating ratios and juggling material lists and requirements. Hopefully with this in mind many more players will be able to enjoy the game and wont find these aspects of the game as much of a chore.
